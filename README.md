# Final-Year-Project

Today, AI is everywhere, and we are able to do many things with it. I will be exploring one of the key areas within AI, classification, which is a field currently under research, and we have not fully yet found out the limitations. We've trained AI which can classify animals, plants, cars, and medicine, among other things. 
However, the main problem in hand revolves around the AI's capability to effectively classify manipulated images and the extent of training required to enable the AI to reliably detect these altered images.
This is where the AI is most vulnerable as it is not able to adapt quickly to evolving image manipulation techniques, and this is what I will be aiming to research and come to a solution where I aim to see how easily I can manipulate the AI into classifying the hacked images.

For this project, the approach I will be using Agile Iterative methodology, as mentioned, the project will run through phases and I will be testing and improving each phase.

**Design:**
The designing and model of the system can be implemented by using basic flowcharts and class diagrams.

**Implementation:**
Implementing this project will require Deep Learning methods, Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to create a classifier where I use 1 Major dataset and 1 toy dataset to implement this solution and examine whether it is able to determine if the image is hacked. 
I will use GANs to expand the dataset and assess the AI's ability to detect hacked images.  This will help me train the dataset to improve accuracy, ultimately leading to a solution. I will further look if there is a scope to implement activation maps once I have been able to successfully train the AI to identify hacked images. This can provide me with a better understanding of where the AI can be trained and improved to achieve higher accuracy.

**Evaluation:**
To evaluate this project, I will be using analysis where I will test the image classifier each time to see if it detects the hacked images, then see what has gone wrong and train the datasets again to see if the classifier detects it. This will help me evaluate each time, and I will be able to improve it by training the dataset once I am able to visualize this, using this method also ensures I can use trial and error method to adjust based on the results I am getting and improve further.
